## AVR CRUD single-page app built with Backbone.js

This example shows how to build a RESTful single-page-app with AVR. This version is a slightly updated version of the same example you'll find [here](https://github.com/ASNApalooza/Lab2014.SinglePageApp.)

One of the changes made to the original in this program is that this one is using the [ASNA.Helpers.Routing class library](https://github.com/ASNA/ASPNET-ASNA-Helpers-Routing). 

The [documentation](https://asnapalooza.github.io/Lab2014.SinglePageApp/#overview) written for the original also applies to this version. This version is the one that will be maintained in the future.
